            The Bit Buckets have been hard at work on their latest creation. The 2015 <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition build season is underway, and the team
            is several weeks into the design and testing of a laser-cut machine capable of collecting five gray totes and a recycling can (game pieces).
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            This year's game is "Recycle Rush". Teams must create stacks of 8lb gray totes, then cap them with green recycling bins and throw away their litter (pool noodles)
            by placing it in the recycling bins. A large step in the center of the field separates the two alliances, creating an offensive-driven game.

          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Using the tools on hand at the Xerocraft hackerspace, the Bit Buckets have created a functioning prototype created almost entirely out of 
            laser-cut 1/4" plywood. It features an elevator capable of holding 5 totes, as well as an omnidirectional drivebase and can grabbing claw.

            Jackalope Science was organized exclusively for educational, scientific and/or charitable purposes. The mission of Jackalope Science is to kickstart a 
            passion for science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) in young people and society as a whole, by building robots and other wonders.
          </p>
          <h3>1: Competitive Robotics</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <img src="assets/img/bitbuckets/nero.png" height="150" class="img-rounded img-left" alt="" />
            Our primary project is competitive robotics in which young people work with adult mentors to build high-tech robots in an environment similar to that 
            of business.  We sponsor the Bit Buckets Robotics team, which participates in a number of competitions. Their primary activity is participation in the FIRST 
            Robotics Competition, which promotes teamwork, sportsmanship, competition without hostility such as helping an opponent fix their robot, and “gracious 
            professionalism” ™. The mission of FIRST Robotics is
          </p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
              "to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based 
              programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, 
              communication, and leadership."

          <p  class="text-justify">
            FIRST Robotics offers a friendly, courteous atmosphere, which builds leadership and high-level social skills. The Bit Buckets 
            also participate in the National Underwater Robotics Competition and in Vex Robotics, which is designed for middle school students. Members of the Bit Buckets 
            Robotics team are encouraged to do outreach events to share their passion for science, mentor and launch other teams, offer educational workshops, and 
            participate in other community projects.

            Another project of Jackalope Science is the Inclusion Project, which promotes diversity in science. We work to overcome the under-representation 
            of women and minorities interested in technical careers. The percentage of scientists and engineers who are women was a mere 24% in 2009. We strive to achieve 
            inclusiveness in the populations we work with directly. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            We plan to offer educational workshops and special outreach for women and girls in the community, as well as 
            reach out to students with low socio-economic status and under-resourced public schools, working to connect them with private sector initiatives to ensure the 
            economic future of the state. We provide students from lower socio-economic backgrounds the opportunity to network with professionals in industry and 
            research and higher education. Tucson has significant populations of Latinos and Native Americans, and we reach out to spread the enthusiasm for STEAM. For 
            instance, we will profile “Grandmothers of STEAM,” women who break the stereotype that seniors don’t compute or understand technology.

            Another project of Jackalope Science is the Maker Project in support of people inventing, designing, creating and carrying out hands-on learning.  Modern 
            society offers fewer opportunities to watch people build and fix things.  Most young people are not proficient with use of tools, electronics, metalworking, and do not 
            know how to do simple tasks such as joining two pieces of wood together.  In this program, youths are invited to participate in group-build projects, which will 
            allow them to design and fabricate custom machines or devices.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <img src="assets/img/bitbuckets/bitbucketspallbearer.jpg" height="150" class="img-rounded img-right" alt="" />
            One such project is the Tucson Pumpkin Toss, which builds trebuchets, catapults, and onagers to 
            launch 4-pound pumpkins. We break the boundaries of in-school learning and help student learn by doing. We welcome everyone to self-identify as a maker and easily 
            apply their creativity, ingenuity and technical skills to solve problems in their lives, homes, schools, workplaces, and for society itself.  The Maker Project program 
            encourages recycling, repurposing, and upcycling.

          <h3>4: Safety First</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            We also offer a Safety First program.  The robotics work and the group build projects pose potential safety risks, so we educate all of 
            our participants to be safe while working.  Moreover, our participants act as Safety Ambassadors by conducting community training and workshops. We 
            produce safety animations and publish them online. We partner with other safety organizations. In the future we expect to increase the public training and site visits 
            for our community.
